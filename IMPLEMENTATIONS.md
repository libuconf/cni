# Implementations
A per-language list of CNI implementations, along with their last-checked compliance level and any notes.
Once CNI becomes versioned, the last-known version implemented will also be recorded.

## Rust
* [Johann150/cni](https://github.com/Johann150/cni/)  
  `core`: 32/32, `ini`: fully compliant, `ext`: tabulation, flexspace  
  No API as of now, simply populates a hashmap
