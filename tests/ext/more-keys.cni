# keys can now also contain other characters (but never `[`, `]`, `=`, `#`, or white space; if `ini` is implemented also not `;`)
# because raw keys also do not exist, backticks are also prohibited in keys to "fail fast"
# ini style comments are not tested
path/to/a/file = some metadata # wow
C:\windows\paths\work = too
クッキー = nice
