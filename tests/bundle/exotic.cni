# there are many *additional* features that cni can make use of
# here are some of the more exotic ones!

# when writing headers, you can indent them for human readability
# standalone comments can also be indented, as well as entries
# consider:

[base]
	# this can be a bit confusing:
	[base.subcat] # just because it's indented doesn't mean you can skip the full prefix
		# like this, see?
	# it also doesn't have to be aligned in any specific way
		key = value

# due to the potential for confusion mentioned above
# it's not recommended that example cni files have any indentation

# you can have whitespace of all kinds inside of the header
# and for the empty header, it can be any amount of whitespace

[ spaces ]
[	tabs	]
[
	newlines
] # yes even this

newlinekey = value # just to demonstrate that it really works

[] # empty
[
	
] # also empty

newline = value # ditto

# similarly, you can have arbitrary whitespace between a key, the equal, and the value
valnl =
	value starts here # "value starts here"

keynl
	= ditto # "ditto"

nlnl
	=
		even this works # "even this works"

raw
=
`this works too` # "this works too"

# note that this is highly discouraged,
# since you cannot put a comment after the = but before the value, for instance

# another optional feature you shouldn't depend on is multiple declarations per line
# though all but the last one has to be a raw string, and you can't have comments until after the last one
a = `b` c = `d`

# and of course, this is just plain cursed, I'm sure you can see it
[sect] a = `b` c = `d`
