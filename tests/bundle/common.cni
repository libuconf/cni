# this is a sample of the CNI format
; comments start with #s and ;s
# this file is a sample of how we *expect* people to use the file format
# it's useful for integration tests of parsers

# fundamentally, cni is a key-value store
key = value

# values are barewords, and can have multiple "words" in them
multi = multiple word value

# you can also have a comment after a bareword value, like this
comment = this variable # will have a value of "this variable" - note the lack of the trailing space

# specifically, bareword values can have any glyphs EXCEPT:
# * vertical spaces
# * trailing/leading horizontal space
# * "#" (comment start) and ";" (comment start)
# if you want anything else, you have to use raw strings, like this:
raw = ` raw string # here ` # you can still have a comment after, has value of " raw string # here "

# the only restricted character in raw strings is the ` - the initiator
# you can still add it into a raw string by having two of them next to each other
# it even works at the start and end!
rawesc = `raw with `` escaped` # has the value of "raw with ` escaped"

# one really powerful thing ini has (and cni doubles down on) are categories
# in cni, categories are declared using a header, same as in ini, for example, like so:
[cat] # you can have a comment here

# every key from here on out will be prefixed with "cat."
key = value # the key of this value is actualy "cat.key", not "key"

# in fact, you can also have subcategories - with an arbitrary amount of nesting
[cat.subcat]
key = value # the key of this value is "cat.subcat.key"

# you can reset the prefix by having an empty header
[]

# you can also skip the headers and just type the keys out
cat.subcat.key2 = value # the key of this value is "cat.subcat.key2"

# importantly, keys are very restricted
# * they can only contain alphanumerics (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - and _)
# * they can also contain "."s, but they can't end on them
# the contents of the headers are actually considered keys!

# [cat.] ; invalid
# cat.key. = value ; invalid

# there's a lot more you can do with cni.
# for that, see the "exotic" bundle
