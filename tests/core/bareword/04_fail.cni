# there is no bareword value that would make parsing fail on its own
# the only disallowed characters are vertical spaces (meaning the next line is the new record)
# and comment characters (meaning everything after that starts a comment)
# however, trying to have a vertical character in a bareword means you will not have a valid line next
# that is what this tests
